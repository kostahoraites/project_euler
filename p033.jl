Digit cancelling fractions

Problem 33

The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

   # do nothing
   #if both numerator and denominator end in zero, considered trivial

    global n_inexp = n

   nd_r_inexp = reduced_fraction(n_inexp, d_inexp)  # [num, denom]
   if nd_r == nd_r_inexp
      # if reduced numerator and denominator are the same, the numbers are equal

#Cool! the product of the four digit canceling fractions is 1/100
print("the four non-trivial digit canceling fractions are: $fracs \n")
print("the denominator (in lowest terms) of the product of these four fractions is: $d_final \n")
